# Exercise 8.2

Write a MATLAB function `[Q, R] = mgs(A)` (see next lecture) that computes a reduced QR factorization
*A = QR* of an *m* by *n* matrix with `m >= n` using modified Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization. The output
variables are a matrix *R* in the set of *m* by *n* matrices over the field of complex numbers with orthonormal
columns and a triangular matrix *R* in the set of *n* by *n* matrices over the field of complex numbers.

## Solution

My implementation uses Python instead of MATLAB. Run with

```bash
./poetry run python main.py
```
